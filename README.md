If you are like me, you spend almost every moment on your Linux desktop in the
command line. With this python script, you can quickly add Todoist tasks via
the command line.

Setup:

1. Install `todoist-python`:

```python
pip3 install --user todoist-python
```

2. Add your API token in a file name '.todoist' in your home directory

3. Add some tasks!

```python
doist.py This is a new task \#project @label
```

4. Optional: Setup a shortcut to a directory in your $PATH
